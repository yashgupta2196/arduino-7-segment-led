# 7-segment display & LED using Arduino

This is my Digital Logic & Design project.

Using Arduino, I have created a setup that generates a random number between 1 and 6 (electronic-dice), and displays this number on a 7-segment display, and on a 2x3 grid of LED lights, similar to a conentional dice.

The code and documentation ahe been provided.
